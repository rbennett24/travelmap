# travelmap
R code and data files for an interactive html map showing places I've lived and visited. The main file is travelmap.R, everything else is just input/supporting files.

Note that the input is a set of .csv files specifying "City" and "Country" or "State" in separate columns. The scripts should fill in everything else.
